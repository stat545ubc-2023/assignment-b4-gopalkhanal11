# Project Information
This repository contains the source code for this project, including all the files for the Assignment B4 of course STAT545 B. The main tasks of this project were:
-   Making a plot of the most common words in the book
-   Making a function that converts words to custom version of Pig Latin
-   Demonstrating the use of `purrr` package functionality in modeling


**The files included in this repository, and their description is provided below** 

-   **README.md:** This is a description of repository of assignment B4
-   **Assignment-b4.Rmd:** This is the R markdown file for milestone 4 with all codes and tasks. This includes exercises 1, 2 & 3. 

The Exercise 1 includes removing the stop words from any book and then making a graph of most frequent words in that book. I have used the book ** Pride and Prejudice** from Jane Austen's collection of novels.

The Exercise 2 contains codes of function that converts words to custom version of Pig Latin. 

The Exercise 3  demonstrates the functionality of R package `purrr`in the modeling context where functions such as `map`, `nest` are extremely useful.
